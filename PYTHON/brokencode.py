# The following code is broken in at least six ways. It is your job to fix it. 
# The program is supposed to take a user entered temperature value, a user entered 
# temperature unit, and a unit to convert to, then output the appropriate 
# conversion. The conversions should be correct, I checked them quickly, but 
# I'm fairly sure they're right. At any rate, the main point is to figure out 
# how the code is broken, and fix it.

# We'll use this code in another exercise.
